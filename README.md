# Mesh Variant Tool

In this repo, I have created a tool that allows creating mesh variants at runtime. 

I have built this tool following the modeling and uv methods used by [Imphenzia](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzfWju7SFoWLCyV_gDVCrGA). Best used with low poly models and has a texture limit of 16 px x 16 px.

***Important Note*** 

Any Textures used by this tool must be Read/Write Enabled, Filter Mode is Point and Compression is none. 

Any Model used by this tool must be Read/Write Enabled. 

***Helpful Hints*** 

In Harper.Tools > Mesh-Variant > Scripts > Editor, select MeshVariantTextureWindow.cs and in the Inspector select the default Texture. 

Do the same for MeshVariant.cs.
